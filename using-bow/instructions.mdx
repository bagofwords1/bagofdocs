Instructions are **critical** for getting accurate, consistent results from your AI agent. They transform the agent from a generic query tool into a domain expert that understands your specific business context, data quirks, and calculation logic.

Think of instructions as your organization's shared knowledge base. They capture the tribal knowledge that typically lives in people's heads or scattered documentation - business definitions, data relationships, calculation formulas, coding standards, and best practices. Once documented as instructions, this knowledge becomes available to everyone through the AI agent.

**Common scenarios where instructions make a difference:**

* **Ambiguous terms**: "Active user" might mean different things across teams. Instructions define it precisely.
* **Complex calculations**: Revenue recognition rules, churn formulas, or cohort definitions need exact specifications.
* **Data quality issues**: Known data gaps, column meanings, or table relationships that aren't obvious.
* **Business rules**: Filters that should always apply, date ranges to use, or tables to prioritize.
* **Code standards**: Formatting preferences, library usage, or architectural patterns.

Without instructions, the agent makes educated guesses - sometimes right, sometimes wrong. With instructions, it follows your organization's exact specifications every time.

## Instruction Examples

Here are practical examples of instructions across different use cases:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Defining Business Terms" icon="book-open">
    Use instructions to create consistent definitions across your organization.

    ```
    An "active user" is defined as a user with at least one session 
    in the last 30 days. Use this definition for all activity-based metrics.
    ```

    **Category**: General  
    **Scope**: All data sources
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Prioritizing Data Sources" icon="database">
    Guide the agent to use the right tables and avoid test or staging data.

    ```
    When analyzing customer data, always use the `customers_prod` table 
    instead of `customers_staging`. The staging table contains test data.
    ```

    **Category**: Data Modeling  
    **Scope**: Production database
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Describing Column Meanings" icon="columns">
    Explain coded values or non-obvious column semantics.

    ```
    The `status_code` column in the orders table uses these values:
    - 1: Pending
    - 2: Processing  
    - 3: Shipped
    - 4: Delivered
    - 5: Cancelled
    - 6: Refunded
    ```

    **Category**: Data Modeling  
    **Scope**: Orders table
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Calculation Formulas" icon="calculator">
    Specify exact formulas for complex business metrics.

    ```
    To calculate Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR):
    MRR = SUM(subscription_amount) WHERE billing_frequency = 'monthly'
    + SUM(subscription_amount / 12) WHERE billing_frequency = 'annual'
    + SUM(subscription_amount / 3) WHERE billing_frequency = 'quarterly'
    ```

    **Category**: General  
    **Scope**: Subscriptions data source
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="SQL Best Practices" icon="code">
    Share data modeling techniques and query optimization tips.

    ```
    When joining tables on *_id fields, always cast integer IDs to strings 
    or vice versa to avoid type mismatch errors. Example:
    JOIN table2 ON table1.user_id::text = table2.user_id
    ```

    **Category**: Data Modeling  
    **Scope**: All data sources
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Code Standards" icon="file-code">
    Enforce coding conventions and library preferences.

    ```
    For all Python data processing scripts:
    - Use pandas for data manipulation
    - Follow PEP 8 naming conventions
    - Include docstrings for all functions
    - Handle missing values explicitly with .fillna() or .dropna()
    ```

    **Category**: Code  
    **Scope**: All data sources
  </Accordion>

## Creating Instructions

Anyone can suggest instructions by clicking **"+ Add Instruction"** on the Instructions page. Admins approve or reject suggestions.

![Customize prompt LLM](/assets/media/instructions/instructions.png)

**Instruction Content**: Enter the rule, code snippet, or guidance the agent should follow.

**Scope**: Control when the instruction applies
* All Data Sources - applies globally
* Specific Data Source - limits to one source (e.g., PostgreSQL)
* Table References - narrows to specific tables

**Category**: Choose when to apply the instruction
* **General** - all queries (business rules, definitions)
* **Data Modeling** - building queries and joins (SQL practices)
* **Code** - code generation (coding standards)

New instructions start as **Draft - Pending Approval**. Admins can approve (Published) or reject (Archived) them.

## Managing Instructions

The instructions page shows **Published** (active) and **Suggested** (pending) tabs. Filter by creator type or category.

**Approval (Admin Only)**: Go to the **Suggested** tab, click an instruction, review it, change **Status** to approve or reject, then click **"Update Instruction"**.

## AI Auto-Generated Instructions

During report sessions, when you provide clarifications or corrections, Bag of words will automatically detect these as potential instructions and suggest saving them.

**Example**: If you clarify "Treat an active user as a user with at least one session in the last 30 days for all activity-based metrics," the system will offer to save this as a draft instruction for future use.

This ensures valuable domain knowledge is captured organically during analysis and made available across your organization.

<Note>Autosuggesting instructions can be turned off/on in the AI settings page</Note>

## Monitoring Instruction Effectiveness

Admins can track instruction performance through the **Monitoring** dashboard:

* **Coverage Metrics**: See how many queries benefit from instructions
* **Instruction Usage**: Identify which instructions are used most frequently  
* **Effectiveness Scores**: Monitor whether instructions reduce errors and corrections
* **Gaps Analysis**: Discover areas where additional instructions could help

Use these insights to continuously improve your instruction library and agent accuracy.
