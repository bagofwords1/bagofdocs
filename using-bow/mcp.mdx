## Overview

Bag of words exposes an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that allows you to connect external AI tools like Claude Desktop, Cursor, or any MCP-compatible client directly to your data sources. This enables you to query your data using natural language from your favorite AI tools.

With the MCP Server, you can:

* **Query data from Claude Desktop**: Ask questions about your data directly in Claude
* **Use Cursor for data analysis**: Leverage your IDE's AI capabilities with your connected data sources
* **Integrate with any MCP client**: Build custom workflows using the standardized MCP protocol

## Available Tools

The Bag of words MCP Server exposes the following tools for AI assistants to interact with your data:

| Tool Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `create_report` | Creates a new analysis session (report). Call this at the start of a conversation to get a report_id for subsequent tool calls. Auto-attaches all active data sources. |
| `get_context` | Retrieves available data sources, tables, and metadata resources. Useful for understanding what data is available before running queries. Supports optional regex pattern filtering. |
| `inspect_data` | Quick, ephemeral data inspection for exploration and debugging. Previews data (head/tail), checks column types, and validates assumptions. Results are logged but not saved as persistent visualizations. Returns a sample of 3 rows. |
| `create_data` | Creates tracked, reproducible data visualizations (chart or table) with Query/Step/Visualization persistence. Results are saved to the report and can be shared/added to dashboards. Tables are auto-discovered from the prompt if not provided. |
| `list_instructions` | Lists instructions from the current live build. Instructions are organizational knowledge that guide AI behavior. Supports filtering by status, category, and text search. |
| `create_instruction` | Creates a new instruction that guides AI code generation and data analysis. Auto-versioned with build integration. Admins get instant approval; non-admins go to pending approval. |

## Enable MCP Server

Administrators can enable or disable the MCP endpoint from **Settings** → **Integrations**.

Toggle the **BOW MCP Server** switch to enable MCP endpoint for integration with AI assistants like Cursor, Claude, or others.

## Getting Started

### 1. Access the MCP Configuration

Click **MCP** in the left navigation menu to open the MCP Server configuration popup.

![MCP Server Configuration](/assets/media/mcp-server.png)

### 2. Generate an Access Token

Click **Regenerate Token** to create a new access token. This token authenticates your MCP client with Bag of words.

<Warning>
Keep your access token secure. Anyone with this token can query your data sources through the MCP server.
</Warning>

### 3. Configure Your MCP Client

Copy the configuration snippet and add it to your MCP client's configuration file. The configuration looks like this:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "bagofwords": {
      "url": "https://<YOUR_DOMAIN>/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `<YOUR_DOMAIN>` with your Bag of words instance URL and `<YOUR_API_KEY>` with your actual access token.

## Client Configuration

### Claude Desktop

Add the configuration to your Claude Desktop settings file:

**macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

**Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

### Cursor

Add the configuration to your Cursor MCP settings to enable data querying directly from your IDE.

### Custom MCP Clients

Any client that supports the MCP protocol can connect using the URL and authorization header shown in your configuration panel.

## MCP Reports

Reports created through MCP connections are automatically tracked in your Reports page and marked with an MCP icon for easy identification.

![MCP Reports](/assets/media/mcp-reports.png)

When you open an MCP-generated report, you'll see a banner indicating it was created via MCP. The report displays the generated data and visualizations from the tool calls made by the external AI assistant.

![MCP Report View](/assets/media/mcp-report-view.png)

<Warning>
**Important**: For MCP-generated reports, the actual LLM completion/prompt content is **not saved**, but all tool usage is **tracked 100%**. 

This means you can see exactly what data was queried and which tools were used, while the conversational context from the external client (Claude, Cursor, etc.) remains private.
</Warning>

## Managing API Tokens

You can manage multiple access tokens from the MCP configuration panel:

* **View active tokens**: See all tokens created for your workspace with their creation dates
* **Regenerate tokens**: Create new tokens when needed
* **Revoke tokens**: Remove tokens that are no longer needed for security

## Use Cases

### Data Analysis in Claude

Once connected, you can ask Claude questions about your data:

* "What were our top 10 customers by revenue last month?"
* "Show me the trend of user signups over the past year"
* "Which products have the highest return rate?"

### Development Workflows in Cursor

Use the MCP integration while coding to:

* Validate data assumptions while building features
* Generate test data based on production patterns
* Debug data-related issues with real-time queries
* Build data models with full context of the data warehouse
