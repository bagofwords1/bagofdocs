Dashboards let you turn answers and data into a clear, visual story. You can build one manually with full control, or let the AI design a layout for you in seconds.

Dashboards are great for telling a story by combining charts, tables, and explanatory text into a narrative. They also facilitate collaboration and scalability by allowing you to share dashboards with teammates and keep them updated on a schedule.

## Ways to create a dashboard

* **Manual**: Open a new report, and click the top right **Dashboard** button to open the dashboard canvas. 
  The canvas is a visual grid, where you can add/remove widgets, resize and move them in the canvas area.
  - You can add visuals that are were created in left chat pane. 
  - You can add text widgets via the plus button at the top

* **AI Generated**: Simply type in chat, "Create a dashboard about …" to initiate the process.
Watch as the dashboard takes shape in real-time, with blocks being added progressively.
Once complete, the dashboard will display a polished layout and narrative text.
Feel free to rearrange or modify any elements as needed.


## The Canvas

* **Drag & drop layout**
  - Move items where you want them; resize to fit the content.
  - Items snap cleanly into a grid and won't overlap.

* **Add and edit content**
  - **Visualizations**: Add charts/tables tied to your queries.
  - **Text widgets**: Write headings, explanations, insights, lists, and links.

* **Remove**
  - Use the item controls to remove a visualization or text block.

* **Fullscreen**
  - Open a distraction‑free view for reviews or presentations.

* **Themes**
  - Choose a theme to set background, text, and card styling; updates apply instantly.

* **Share**
  - Share a dashboard link with teammates so everyone sees the same layout and visuals.

* **Schedule**
  - Set dashboards to refresh and send automatic updates (e.g., periodic email summaries).

## Editing Visualizations

* **Choose a chart type**
  - Bar, line, area, pie, scatter, heatmap, candlestick, treemap, radar, table, count.

* **Map your data**
  - Pick the category (x‑axis or grouping), values/series, or x/y fields depending on the chart.
  - Helpful suggestions appear based on your data.

* **Style and options**
  - Toggle titles, legends, axes, and grid lines.
  - Adjust label rotation and spacing for readability.
  - Set variants (e.g., smooth/area) and custom style options (colors, borders).

* **Apply vs Save**
  - **Apply**: Updates the current view.
  - **Save**: Persists the visualization so it stays consistent across the dashboard.

## Tips for Great Dashboards

* Start with a title and summary to frame the story.
* Group related visuals side‑by‑side; keep a logical flow left‑to‑right, top‑to‑bottom.
* Use text to explain the "so what" near each visual.
* Balance sizes: smaller for KPIs, medium for trend lines, larger for dense tables or multifaceted charts.
* Pick readable themes and rotate labels when categories are long.
* Iterate with AI: ask it to add missing context, alternate views, or better layout ideas.
