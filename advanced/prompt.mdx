How to get the best results from your prompts

---

## Tips for Better Prompts:

- Be specific about what you want to visualize or analyze
- Mention the type of visualization if you have a preference (table, bar chart, line chart, etc.)
- Include time periods or specific metrics you're interested in
- Ask follow-up questions to modify existing visualizations

## Example Prompts:

- "Show me monthly sales trends in a line chart"
- "Create a table of top 10 customers by revenue"
- "Add a profit margin column to this table"
- "Convert this table into a bar chart"
- "Create a dashboard showing sales performance overview"
