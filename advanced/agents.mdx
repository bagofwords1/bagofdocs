## Agent Types and Capabilities
---
### Planner Agent
The Planner agent is the strategic orchestrator of the analysis process:
- **Primary Role**: Converts user requests into structured analysis plans
- **Key Capabilities**:
  - Breaks down complex queries into actionable steps
  - Determines optimal analysis sequence
  - Identifies required data sources and transformations
- **Input Processing**:
  - User prompts and context
  - Data schemas
  - Historical analysis context
  - Previous conversation memory
- **Output**: Structured action plan containing:
  - Widget creation/modification steps
  - Question-answering tasks
  - Dashboard design instructions

### Coder Agent
The Coder agent transforms analysis plans into executable code:
- **Primary Role**: Generates Python code for data processing
- **Key Capabilities**:
  - Writes optimized data transformation logic
  - Handles multiple data source integrations
  - Implements error handling and validation
- **Specialties**:
  - DataFrame operations
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing
  - Complex calculations and aggregations
  - Query optimization

### Answer Agent
The Answer agent provides natural language insights:
- **Primary Role**: Generates clear, contextual responses to user questions
- **Key Capabilities**:
  - Data interpretation
  - Trend analysis
  - Statistical explanations
  - Context-aware responses
- **Output Formats**:
  - Markdown-formatted text
  - Bulleted summaries
  - Technical explanations
  - Business insights

### Dashboard Designer Agent
The Dashboard Designer agent creates intuitive data presentations:

### Reporter Agent
The Reporter agent handles documentation and summarization:
- **Primary Role**: Creates report titles and analysis summaries
- **Key Capabilities**:
  - Concise title generation
  - Key insight extraction
  - Progress tracking
  - Analysis documentation
- **Output Types**:
  - Report titles
  - Executive summaries
  - Analysis narratives
  - Progress updates

## Agent Interaction Flow

1. User submits a data analysis request
2. Planner agent creates structured analysis plan
3. Coder agent generates required data processing code
4. Answer agent provides explanations and insights
5. Dashboard Designer agent optimizes visualization layout
6. Reporter agent documents the analysis process

Each agent's output serves as input for subsequent agents, creating a seamless analysis pipeline that transforms raw data into actionable insights.
