You can save queries and data models to your memory. This is a great way to collaborate with your team and share your knowledge.

## Save queries and data models as memories
---
Whenever a user submits a prompt that generates a data model, a memory can be created. A memory will include the data model and the code generated to get the data.
You can then save a memory, add a title and a description, and other users will be able to see and use the memory.
This is very useful to ground your team to use specific tables that are validated and tested.

## Use memories in your prompts
---
In your prompts, you can reference memories by using the @ symbol. Using memories in prompts is recommended, and a great way to provide more context to the LLM so it can generate better results.
For example, if a user saved a "Top Customers" memory, and you want to get the top customers in a specific time period, you can use the following prompt:

```
Get me @Top Customers for the last 30 days
```

You can also reference multiple memories in a single prompt. For example, if you want to get the top customers and the top products, you can use the following prompt:

```
Get me @Top Customers that purchased @Top Products
```
